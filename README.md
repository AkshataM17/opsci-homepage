# OpSci Society

OpSci society is an ecosystem built on three components: 1) Identity & Reputation, 2) Scholarship & Research, and 3) Publishing and Discovery. Each of these components is built on an underlying protocol or platform, Verse, Fellowship, and Commons.

## OpSci Verse

The first decentralized identity directory that links off-chain academic credentials on-chain for DeSci dApps. OpSci Verse empowers researchers to create a portable account for web-native scientists that can be used to interact with any DeSci web application. Choose to be pseudonymous or not. Control how you present your scientific persona online. Prove your credentials while remaining private.

## OpSci Commons

Commons is a free, open-access platform for publishing and discovering large scientific datasets, computational workflows, and digital laboratory notebooks. Knowledge artifacts are permanently archived on decentralized storage networks. We've indexed over 500TB of neuroimaging data made available through datalad for permanent archival on Filecoin and peer-to-peer access via IPFS.

## OpSci Fellowship

The OpSci dWeb Fellowship is a 12-week program that provides a stipend for talented undergraduates, students, and post-doctoral scholars to work on open source software development and basic research that aligns with the Opscientia mission. Fellows have made wide contributions to DeSci, such as the Decentralized Autonomous Research Community Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Elements [(DARC-SPICE)](https://opsci.gitbook.io/darc-spice/) and the paper archival platform, [vScholar](https://github.com/opscientia/v-scholar-web). OpSci also collaborates with other research organizations to generate academic papers that push the field of DeSci forward, such as our recent [pre-print](https://zenodo.org/record/6320575) that places DeSci in the context of cognitive models for sense making, perception, and action.
